*A delightful python OCR module*

This is a simple module for adding quick and easy OCR processing within your python program. In addition to wrapping an OCR engine (currently, only [Tesseract](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/)) it also handles file input quite liberally. Valid file input may be a string of a files path, a file object, or even a URL to a file on the web. As an added bonus, if you need to perform OCR on a PDF, this module will use GhostScript to convert the file to a PNG for Tesseract.

This module is intended for very basic OCR use and is in no way comprehensive. Right now, it is less than 100 LOC and simply calls a Tesseract subprocess.
